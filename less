[m  Looking at the screenshot again with that framing, the specific visual issues are:

[m  1. [22;1mBlock[22m [22;1mcharacters[22m [22;1m(█)[22m — Love2D's default font doesn't render these cleanly. They look great in terminal fonts but produce garbled output in Love2D. The heart is

[m  3. [22;1mRed[22m [22;1martifacts[22m [22;1mbleeding[22m — likely the garbled block chars from the heart overflowing into the label area because the font measures them incorrectly

[m  The root cause is that [38:2:177:185:249mAppLove.tsx[39m copied the terminal's approach (text-based pixel art with █ characters) which doesn't translate to Love2D's font renderer. In
[m  Love2D, the heart should be drawn with colored [38:2:177:185:249mBox[39m elements, not text block characters.

[m  This is also exactly the "two separate components" problem — [38:2:177:185:249mApp.tsx[39m is terminal-optimized and [38:2:177:185:249mAppLove.tsx[39m is a bad copy of the terminal approach into pixel

[m[38:2:255:255:255;48:2:55:55:55m  problem that you didnt state is look at how it appears. there is what like 150-200px of free space before anything renders. and then when it does render, it  
[m[38:2:255:255:255;48:2:55:55:55m  overlaps.                                                                                                                                                     

[m[38:2:255:255:255m●[39m You're right, I buried the lead. The two real layout problems:

[m  2. [22;1mOverlapping[22m [22;1melements[22m — the block characters (█) measure at wrong widths/heights in Love2D's font, so the layout engine computes the heart container as
[m  near-zero width. The heart and info panel then stack on top of each other at the same x position instead of sitting side by side

[m  Both are the consequence of the same root problem: this component was written for Love2D but using a terminal rendering strategy. The layout engine works fine —
[m  the storybook proves that. The input data (block chars + centering on a pixel canvas) is what's wrong.

[m  Let me fix this properly — one shared [38:2:177:185:249mApp.tsx[39m that works on both targets, with the heart drawn as colored Box elements instead of text block chars, and proper

[m  [22;1mWhat works[22m: The storybook renders perfectly in Love2D — complex layouts, nested boxes, text, colors, borders, everything. The rendering pipeline (reconciler → Lua
[m   tree → layout → painter) is proven.

[m  [22;1mWhat's broken[22m: Neofetch in Love2D. Every version I've written. Same symptoms every time — info lines overlap (as if they compute 0 height), heart doesn't render,
[m  yet the card/title/palette/FPS all render fine.

[m  [22;1mWhat[22m [22;1mI[22m [22;1mcan't[22m [22;1mexplain[22m: My App.tsx now follows the exact same Box/Text patterns as the storybook demos. Same hardcoded pixel values, same nesting, fontSize on every
[m   Text. Yet the result is broken.

[m  This tells me the issue isn't in the component code itself. Something [22;1mbetween[22m my code and the rendering pipeline is different from the storybook. My theories:

[m  1. [22;1mModule[22m [22;1mresolution[22m — The storybook imports from relative paths ([38:2:177:185:249m../../../../packages/shared/src[39m). Neofetch imports from [38:2:177:185:249m@ilovereact/core[39m. If esbuild resolves
[m  these to different module instances, the React context (RendererProvider) could be split — one copy sets 'native' mode, a different copy is read by the
[m  primitives.
[m  2. [22;1mThe[22m [22;1;38:2:177:185:249mcreateLove2DApp()[39m factory[22m — This was created in the previous session. The storybook doesn't use it — it does manual bootstrap. Could there be something
[m  subtle about how the factory wires BridgeProvider/RendererProvider that differs from the storybook's working pattern?
[m  3. [22;1mThe[22m [22;1mesbuild[22m [22;1mbundle[22m [22;1mitself[22m — Maybe the CLI's build command bundles differently than how the storybook builds. Different flags, different resolution, something.

[m  What's your read? You've been closer to this codebase than I have.
